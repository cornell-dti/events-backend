No more. When the Internet became a commercial offering in the mid-1990s, investment decisions and economics became the driver that shaped the future. Today we see a confluence of forces\u2014some arising from the intrinsic character of network industries, some arising from the global character of the Internet, and some from commercial incentives\u2014that are leading us to a next major transition in the forces shaping the future\u2014a transition as dramatic as the transition to the commercial world of the 1990s. \n\n \n\nBio: \n\nDavid Clark is a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is technical director of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative. Since the mid-70s, he has been leading the development of the Internet; from 1981-1989 he acted as Chief Protocol Architect in this development, and chaired the Internet Activities Board.

In this context, we predict the role of solid interfaces on the transport and organization of fluids in the subsurface environments for applications related to carbon storage. Recent advances in cross-scale characterization methods now allow us to elucidate the fluid-induced chemical and morphological changes that contribute to observed macro-scale properties of reactivity and flow in subsurface environments. Drawing inspiration from the natural capture, conversion, and storage of CO2 to Ca- and Mg-carbonates via thermodynamically downhill routes, we design reactive separation pathways to remove CO2 from point source emissions and direct the synthesis of clean energy carriers such as hydrogen. We will discuss the alignment of these efforts to advance the scientific basis for developing net zero and negative emissions technologies.", "photo_id": 31688749913838, "detail_views": 33, "event_instances": [{"event_instance": {"id": 31688749821946, "ranking": 0, "event_id": 31688749714812, "start": "2019-10-30T15:30:00-04:00", "end": null, "all_day": false, "num_attending": 0}}], "address": "112 Hollister Drive", "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span><span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span><span><span>Dr.&nbsp;Greeshma Gadikota&nbsp;is an Assistant Professor and Croll Sesquicentennial Fellow in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. </span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span><span>Dr. Gadikota directs the Sustainable Energy and Resource Recovery Group.
